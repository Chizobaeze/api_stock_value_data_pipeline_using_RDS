## api_stock_value_data_pipeline_using_RDS
This project demonstrates a production-grade data pipeline built using Airflow and Airbyte to extract stock market data from the api_stock_data API available on RapidAPI, store the data in Amazon S3, load it into MySQL (hosted on Amazon RDS or locally), and finally sync the curated data into Amazon Redshift for analytics.
